# BankStatementReader

Read bank statement and help companies' bank control for most of UK business banks

Reader always read bank statement vertically which cause unexpected outcome. XD

I normally add a line text '1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111' on the top of the page which will guide reader to read horizontally while he starts to read.

But it not always work. XD

Make sure you have installed nessccary package before running it.
